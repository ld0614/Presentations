**Abstract**

So you've discovered PowerShell, written a few scripts and now want to share them with your colleagues. It might be you've started with a shared network drive or simply emailed the latest version over. This session will demonstrate how easy it is to build a private PowerShell module, fully integrated into an Azure DevOps Pipeline for easy tracking and discovery.

**Script Description**

The template code is available from my other github repository [here](https://github.com/ld0614/PSModuleTemplate)
