**Abstract**

In this session, I will discuss and hopefully demonstrate through videos the creation of a PowerShell module to connect to a Fireworks control system. This system uses a proprietary control protocol running over a serial port. I will discuss the process of creating the module, how to interact with a serial connection using PowerShell and hopefully how these concepts can be used in more practical environments.

Note: I hope to make this a fun and relevant but also slightly off-topic session. It was inspired by the Defcon talk And That's How I Lost My Other Eye...Explorations in Data Destruction - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bpX8YvNg6Y&t=29s

**Script Description**

Unfortunately I will be unable to release the code talked about in this session due to various legal and safely concerns
