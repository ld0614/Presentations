**Abstract**

The Win32 API is the oldest and most powerful API available in Windows. Most of the time there are other ways of achieving a task available which are far simpler and quicker to use. Unfortunately sometimes there is no substitute for the original but accessing these APIs from PowerShell can be challenging with documentation being out of date, woefully inadequate or just missing entirely. In this session weâ€™ll discuss some of the ways PowerShell can interact with Win32 via P/Invoke, how to read and map API interfaces into PowerShell and how to use the Windows SDK to get the latest information

**Notes**

While the code should work it was designed as a quick Proof of Concept to highlight the ideas in the talk.  As such is should not be used in Production without a careful understanding of its limitations.
